# [Catena](https://github.com/alysoid/catena) - Mount Ansible Role

Manage mount points via [systemd.mount](https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemd.mount.5) - Mount unit configuration.

Unit configuration files which name ends in `.mount` encodes information about a file system mount point controlled and supervised by systemd. Optionally, a mount unit may be accompanied by a [systemd.automount](https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemd.automount.5) unit, whose name ends in `.automount`, to allow on-demand or parallelized mounting.
